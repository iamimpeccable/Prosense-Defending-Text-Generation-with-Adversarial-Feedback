# Prosense-Defending-Text-Generation-with-Adversarial-Feedback
ProSense is a multi-stage training framework that boosts LLM truthfulness and robustness using Graph-of-Thought reasoning, adversarial feedback loops, and quantized fine-tuning on Mistral-7B. It identifies logical failures and retrains models through structured error correction.
